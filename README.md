-- DESCRIPTION OF THE DATASET
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus" - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set

The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant:
- Iris-setosa, 
- Iris-virginica,
- Iris-versicolor.

The dataset contains a set of 150 records under five attributes:
- sepal length (in cm), 
- sepal width (in cm), 
- petal length (in cm), 
- petal width (in cm), 
- class.

The line 0 - is header containing description of each row // sepallength,sepalwidth,petallength,petalwidth,class // .
